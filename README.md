# CodeStyle
A web application that makes customized suggestions to improve the legibility of code. Currently supports Python and will suggest formatting tips such as proper code indentation and blocking.

## Motivation
CodeStyle aims to help people overcome a fundamental barrier to learning programming: good coding style.

## Tech/framework used
Built with the latest version of React as a frontend and utilizes Flask as a backend.

## Features
While most existing code formatters transform the userâ€™s code without providing explanations behind the changes, this tool helps the user improve their coding style by supplying them with the reasoning behind any formatting suggestions.

## Installation
To build the latest working version on your local machine, `cd` to the project directory.

* `cd` into the `static` directory and run `npm run watch` to let `webpack` build the web app

* `cd` into the `server` directory and then run `python server.py` to start the web server

Once done, navigate to `localhost:5000` in your favorite browser to open the application.

## Future Implementations
We hope to extend CodeStyle to support other languages.
