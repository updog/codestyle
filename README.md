## Installation
To build the latest working version on your local machine, `cd` to the project directory.

* `cd` into the `static` directory and run `npm run watch` to let `webpack` build the web app

* `cd` into the `server` directory and then run `python server.py` to start the web server

Once done, navigate to `localhost:5000` in your favorite browser to open the application.

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests
Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## How to use?
If people like your project theyâ€™ll want to learn how they can use it. To do so include step by step guide to use your project.
